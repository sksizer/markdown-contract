// D-0011 / C-0009 — occurrence count on a `requires` entry: a phrase must appear at least `min`
// times in the bound scope. Here every checklist step must be marked `DONE` — the section
// requires the `DONE` marker at least twice. A below-`min` document is a count violation,
// reported under the `text/count` area (distinct from a plain presence `text/requires` miss).
//
// Greened by T-TXAP (the matcher + builders are live). The expected finding id is the
// synthesized per-entry id `text/count/checklist/<patternHash>` (a `min`/`max` violation keeps
// the `count` finding kind); the count violation pins at the section heading (line 1). Note the
// `DONE` markers live in list items — the section scope text includes every block, not just prose.
