 * rows). Both return 1-indexed source line numbers.
 *
 * `codeBlockLines` walks `tree.mdast` (layer-0) rather than the heading-direct `SectionNode.blocks`,
 * so code fences nested inside lists / blockquotes — which the section projection does not hoist —
 * are still covered. `tableRowLines` reads the projected table blocks (recursively), whose header
 * `pos` and per-row `rowPos` already give the exact row lines (the separator row forms no data row,
