# Packaging — a generic core, one package, three layers

## Summary

- The core engine is **generic**: it knows nothing about SDLC, entities, or Obsidian vaults — SDLC contracts are just data fed to it.
- This repo ships **one npm package** — `exports` → the library, `bin` → the CLI — over three layers (engine / runner / cli) with strictly one-way imports (cli → runner → core).
- Standard Node ESM + npm: build to `dist/` via `tsc`, registry-installable, no bespoke build substrate.
- The engine's read-only / mdast-retained / repair-free / LLM-free *posture* is its own decision — [[D-0007-engine-scope-and-fidelity]] — not folded into this packaging ADR.
- The Obsidian dialect ships as an **in-repo module** (`src/core/dialect/`), following the in-house resolution of [[D-0002-projection-and-dialect]] — no separately published package.

## Context

The original ask was a *generic, configurable* library, and the consuming corpus (SDLC's planning set) must remain just one data set fed to it — not baked in. That shapes both the layering (a core that knows only markdown / mdast / Zod) and the packaging (a library other projects install, plus a CLI that gates a corpus). This repo is the extraction of that engine from the prior in-repo design, so the package shape is decided here, fresh, rather than inherited.

## Decision

### Layering — a generic core, SDLC as data

```text
src/
  core/      # the engine — projection, grammar, leaves, validate, model, finding; knows markdown/mdast/Zod only
  runner/    # corpus runner — directory→contract config, tree walk, finding aggregation; library API
  cli/       # the bin — arg parsing, human/json/sarif formatting; a thin shell over the runner
```

Imports are strictly one-way: **cli → runner → core**. The core never imports the runner or cli; the runner never imports the cli. SDLC-specific knowledge (entity types, per-type contracts) lives entirely in *data* — contract modules a consumer supplies — never in the engine.

### Packaging — one package, two entry points

A single npm package exposes both surfaces:

- `exports` → the library (the core engine + the runner as importable API).
- `bin` → the CLI (`markdown-contract validate <path> [--format human|json|sarif]`).

Standard Node ESM and npm: TypeScript built to `dist/` via `tsc`, registry-installable, no bespoke build substrate. The runner is library API, so other consumers reuse it in-process rather than shelling out to the bin.

### Migration touchpoints (§8)

Extracting this engine retires the prior in-repo machinery: `validateBody` + `extractH2Headings` (→ the grammar over the projection), `body-schema.yaml` (→ a `contract.ts` per type), the line scanners and the three alias tables (→ `oneOf` + named rules), and the duplicated `FRONTMATTER_RE` slicers (→ the package's single `parse`). Each per-type `contract.ts` becomes just data fed to the generic engine.

## Why

- **A generic core pays back three ways.** It is unit-testable against plain fixture markdown with zero SDLC scaffolding; it is reusable outside this repo; and the SDLC-specific knowledge stays where it belongs — in per-type contract *data*, not in the engine. Keeping SDLC as data is the difference between a library and a one-corpus tool.
- **One package because the surfaces are one engine.** The CLI is a thin shell over the runner, and the runner is the core's public API — splitting them into separate packages would version-couple two halves of one build for no isolation gain. `exports` + `bin` from one package is the standard Node shape for "library that also has a CLI".
- **Scope and fidelity are a separate decision.** This ADR covers only how the engine is *layered and packaged*; what the engine does to a document (read-only, mdast-retained, repair-free, LLM-free) is recorded in [[D-0007-engine-scope-and-fidelity]].

## Options considered

### Packaging the engine + CLI — one package vs split packages

#### Option A: one package, `exports` + `bin` (chosen framing)

A single `markdown-contract` package exposes the library via `exports` and the CLI via `bin`, with the runner as shared library API. The CLI and library version together (they are one engine), one publish, one build, one dependency set. The slight cost — a library consumer pulls the CLI's arg-parsing dependency tree — is marginal and avoidable with care, and is outweighed by never having to keep two packages' versions in lockstep by hand.

#### Option B: split packages (`markdown-contract` library + `markdown-contract-cli` bin)

A separate CLI package depending on the library. Cleaner dependency isolation for pure-library consumers, and the CLI can iterate its UX independently. But it introduces a version-coupling seam (the CLI must track the library's API), a second publish/release cadence, and a cross-package import boundary for what is one engine with two front doors. Rejected for this repo: the isolation gain does not pay for the coordination cost when the runner is already the clean library API the CLI shells over.

### The Obsidian dialect parser — independent package vs in-repo module

The dialect (the build-vs-adopt subject of [[D-0002-projection-and-dialect]]) could be an **independently published package** — reusable by any unified/remark consumer, versioned on its own — or an **in-repo module** under the core, simpler to evolve in lockstep while the dialect's shape settles. **Resolved: in-repo.** D-0002 settled the dialect in-house as light recognition passes (`src/core/dialect/`), not a `micromark-extension-obsidian` package, so there is nothing separately publishable to home elsewhere; it lives under the core and can still graduate later if it grows into a general-purpose extension.

## Consequences

- A non-SDLC consumer installs the package and feeds it their own contracts; the engine carries no corpus assumptions, so it is a true general-purpose markdown-contract library.
- The runner being library API means in-process consumers (report ops, other tools) reuse it without a subprocess; the CLI is genuinely thin.
- Retiring the prior scanners / alias tables / slicers consolidates onto the single `parse`, but binds the extraction to porting each per-type contract into `contract.ts` data.

## Open questions

- ~~Whether the dialect ships as an independent published package or starts in-repo.~~ **Resolved:** D-0002 settled the dialect in-house as recognition passes (`src/core/dialect/`) — in-repo, nothing separately published. No open questions remain.
