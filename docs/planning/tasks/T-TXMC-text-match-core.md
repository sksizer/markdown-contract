# Text-match predicate core + the `text/*` finding area

## Goal

Build the runtime foundation every declarative text constraint emits through: a pure text matcher over a bound scope's rendered text, the `text/*` finding area registered in the finding model with its own sort plane, and a stable per-entry finding-id synthesis scheme. This is the piece [[T-TXAP-text-predicate-builders]] wraps into `rule` / `docRule` and the declarative loader ([[T-TXYL-declarative-requires-forbids]]) compiles onto. No declarative or combinator surface yet — just the matcher and the finding plumbing.

## Today

The engine has four finding planes and no notion of a text constraint.

| Location | Role today |
|---|---|
| `src/core/validate.ts#PLANE_ORDER` | The four planes (`frontmatter` / `structure` / `content` / `rule`); any unknown id prefix sorts as `rule` |
| `src/core/registry.ts#defaultRegistry` | The id → default-`FindingLevel` registry, seeded with structure / content / rule defaults |
| `src/core/types.ts` | `Finding`, `Rule`, `DocRule`, `Ctx` (the `finding(...)` factory) |
| `tests/fixtures/validation/17-node-level-custom-rule.ts` | The hand-written shape this work generalizes (a section must mention a token) |

## Proposed

A pure matcher (`src/core/text-match.ts`) takes a scope's rendered text plus one match spec — `{ pattern | regex, normalize, ignoreCase, min, max }` — and returns the occurrence count and the source position of each hit, matching against text **including inline code spans and fenced blocks** (per D-0011). A finding-builder turns a spec + scope into `text/requires` / `text/forbids` / `text/count` findings positioned per D-0011 (a `requires` miss at the scope's heading / document level; a `forbids` hit at the offending line). The `text` plane is registered in `PLANE_ORDER` and the `text/*` defaults (`error`) seeded in `defaultRegistry`. A stable id-synthesis helper produces `text/<kind>/<scopeKey>/<patternHash>` and honors an explicit override.

## Approach

1. Add `src/core/text-match.ts`: a `matchText(text, spec)` returning `{ count, positions }`, with `normalize` (collapse whitespace runs) and `ignoreCase` handling, and literal vs `regex` matching. Match raw text including code.
2. Add a finding-builder that maps a match result + the `min` / `max` bound to `text/requires` / `text/forbids` / `text/count` findings with the D-0011 positions and messages (`note` appended).
3. Add `synthesizeTextId(kind, scopeKey, spec)` → `text/<kind>/<scopeKey>/<patternHash>` (short hash of the normalized pattern), returning the entry's explicit `id` when set.
4. Register the `text` plane: add `"text"` to `PLANE_ORDER` in `src/core/validate.ts` (sort position per D-0011 open question — default after `content`), and seed `text/*` defaults in `src/core/registry.ts`.
5. Peer unit test `src/core/text-match.test.ts`: lead with plain input→output cases (a present literal, an absent literal, a count, a regex, normalize on/off), then edges.

## Files to touch

| Location | Kind | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `src/core/text-match.ts` | new | The pure matcher + finding-builder + id-synthesis helper |
| `src/core/text-match.test.ts` | new | Peer unit test — input→output cases first, then edges |
| `src/core/validate.ts` | modify | Add `"text"` to `PLANE_ORDER` so `text/*` sorts into its own plane |
| `src/core/registry.ts` | modify | Seed `text/requires` / `text/forbids` / `text/count` default levels |
| `src/core/index.ts` | modify | Re-export the new module from the core barrel |

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] AC-1: `matchText(text, spec)` returns the occurrence count and each hit's source position for a literal `pattern` and a `regex`, matching text that includes inline code spans and fenced blocks.
- [ ] AC-2: `normalize` (default true) collapses whitespace runs so a phrase split across a wrapped line still matches; `normalize: false` matches exact bytes; `ignoreCase` folds case.
- [ ] AC-3: The finding-builder emits `text/requires` (miss → heading/document position), `text/forbids` (hit → offending line), and `text/count` (`found N times, expected …`), each with the `note` appended.
- [ ] AC-4: `text/*` findings sort into a dedicated `text` plane (not lumped into `rule`), and carry a default `error` level from the registry, overridable per finding.
- [ ] AC-5: `synthesizeTextId` returns `text/<kind>/<scopeKey>/<patternHash>` — stable across entry reordering (not index-based) — and returns the explicit `id` when the spec sets one.
- [ ] AC-6: `src/core/text-match.test.ts` documents the contract with plain input→output cases first; the suite is green.

## Out of scope

- The gated fixture corpus and the `text-*` enable gates — authored up front by [[T-TXSC-text-constraint-fixture-scaffold]]; this task's own verification is its peer unit test (a validate-level fixture needs the builders to exist, so the matcher has no gated corpus fixture of its own).
- The combinator builders (`requires` / `forbids` / `textRule`) and scope binding — [[T-TXAP-text-predicate-builders]].
- Any YAML / declarative recognition — [[T-TXYL-declarative-requires-forbids]].
- Duplicate / contradiction rejection (a compile-time concern of the declarative loader) — [[T-TXYL-declarative-requires-forbids]].
- Choosing the final id discriminator form (hash vs slug) and SARIF `partialFingerprints` — left as a D-0011 open question; ship the hash form.

## Dependencies

- None new — builds directly on the existing finding model ([[D-0001-finding-model]]) and engine. It is the foundation [[T-TXAP-text-predicate-builders]] depends on.

### Acceptance criteria coverage

- AC-1: auto — `npm run test` (`src/core/text-match.test.ts`: present/absent literal, regex hits each pinned to `{line,col}`, match inside an inline code span).
- AC-2: auto — `npm run test` (the three `normalize` cases — default-on collapses wrapped whitespace, `normalize:false` exact bytes — plus `ignoreCase folds case`).
- AC-3: auto — `npm run test` (`buildTextFindings`: requires-miss at heading/document position, forbids one-per-hit at the offending line, count overflow/shortfall messages, `note` appended).
- AC-4: auto — `npm run test` (a `docRule` driven through public `validate` shows `text/*` sorting between `content` and `rule`; registry seeds `text/requires|forbids|count` = `error`; explicit `spec.level` overrides).
- AC-5: auto — `npm run test` (id shape `text/<kind>/<scopeKey>/<patternHash>`, stable across entry reordering via FNV-1a of the normalized pattern, explicit `spec.id` returned verbatim).
- AC-6: auto — `npm run test` + `npm run typecheck` (peer test leads with plain `matchText` input→output cases, then id synthesis, builder, plane integration; 28/28 green).

### What worked

- One-pass implementation: the sub-agent satisfied all six ACs and produced a 28-case peer test with the quality gate green on the first full run (`OK 2/2`).
- Baseline-gated quality gate cleanly reported zero new drift, so no triage of pre-existing findings was needed.
- The readiness gate passed all mechanical scanners (touchpoints, placeholders, claim-resolvers, corpus-assumptions) with no definition gap — the spec was genuinely implementation-ready as written.

### Friction and automation gaps

- Step 7's baseline-gated gate run from the worktree defaulted `--baseline-dir` to the *worktree's* `.sdlc/quality-baselines/` and failed `baseline not found`, even though Step 3a captured the baseline in the *main repo's* dir — task-work should pass `--baseline-dir <main-repo>/.sdlc/quality-baselines` (or `--project-root <main-repo>`) explicitly at Step 7 so the gate finds the baseline the capture step wrote. → [[T-5HX8-task-work-threads-main-baseline-dir]]
- `lease_authority:` was uncommitted in main's working tree, so a worktree branched from committed main lacked it; every lease shell-out from the worktree needed a `SDLC_LEASE_AUTHORITY=origin` env override — projects adopting leases should commit `lease_authority:` to `sdlc.yaml` so worktrees inherit it, or task-work should resolve and thread the authority to all lease invocations rather than relying on the worktree's `sdlc.yaml`. → [[T-9J63-task-work-threads-lease-authority]]
- Under heavy parallel `/sdlc:task-work` load, the `--commit-on main` verify/start commits were discarded from local `main` by a peer process resetting `main` to `origin/main`, leaving them only on the task branch (main reverted to `open/ready`); the lease guarded re-pickup correctly, but the task-state-on-main invariant did not hold transiently — a follow-up could make the start/verify commits push to a durable ref or detect-and-reland when a peer reset discards them. → [[T-FOJN-task-work-durable-task-state-commits]]
