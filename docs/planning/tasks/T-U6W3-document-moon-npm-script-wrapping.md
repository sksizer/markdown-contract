# Document that moon tasks must wrap npm scripts under moon's runtime-only node toolchain

## Goal

Capture the moon-task authoring convention for this Bun-canonical workspace
([[D-0010-monorepo-tooling]], [[M-0005-monorepo-tooling]]): moon v2's
runtime-only toolchains do not expose `node_modules/.bin` on PATH, so tasks must
invoke their runner explicitly (`bun run <script>` / `bunx …`) rather than call
bin-resolved tools (`tsc`, `vitest`) directly. The one exception is the **`test`
task**, pinned to the **node** toolchain so `vitest` runs under Node as the
Node-compatibility gate (M-0005). Writing this down keeps future moon task
definitions from silently failing with command-not-found and preserves the
bun-for-speed / node-for-the-gate split.

> **Supersedes the original "wrap npm scripts" framing.** When the repo was
> npm-canonical, T-MOON wrapped `npm run …` to get `.bin` on PATH. M-0005 makes
> **Bun** the canonical package manager (carried by
> [[T-WKSP-bun-workspace-split]]), so the convention is now: invoke via
> `bun run` / `bunx`, except the node-pinned `test` task. Document this in the
> project's moon / Develop docs so future task definitions follow it.

> — reframed from the originating note in [[T-MOON-adopt-moon-monorepo]]

## Today

The convention is documented only in its superseded, npm-canonical form:

| Location | Role today |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | **Develop** section states "npm stays canonical … `npm run <script>` works exactly as before", shows `npx moon run :build` examples it describes as wrapping "the same npm scripts above", and a **Pinned versions** table whose roles read "Node — runs build / typecheck / test" and "Bun — pinned forward-looking … runs no task today". |
| `moon.yml` | The `build` task comment explains the no-`.bin`-on-PATH rule for the npm path only: "The npm script is run rather than `tsc` directly because moon v2's runtime-only node toolchain does not put node_modules/.bin on PATH; npm does". |

Once [[T-WKSP-bun-workspace-split]] makes Bun canonical (`bun install` / `bun.lock`, `build`/`typecheck` on the bun toolchain, `test` pinned to node), every one of those statements is wrong — and the reason a task cannot call `tsc`/`vitest` directly is no longer written down for the bun path.

## Proposed

Rewrite the convention docs to match the bun-canonical workspace and state the authoring rule explicitly:

- The **Develop** section reflects Bun as canonical (`bun install`, `bun run …` / `npx moon run :…`), with the pinned-versions roles corrected: **Bun** = installer + `build`/`typecheck` runner; **Node** = the `test` gate and the published-artifact target.
- A short **"Authoring moon tasks"** note (in README, mirrored as a `moon.yml` comment at the edit site) states the rule so future tasks follow it:
  > moon v2's runtime-only toolchains do not put `node_modules/.bin` on PATH, so a task must invoke its runner explicitly — `bun run <script>` / `bunx …`, **not** bare `tsc` / `vitest`. The `test` task is deliberately `toolchain: node` so `vitest` runs under Node as the Node-compatibility gate — don't "simplify" it onto bun.

## Approach

This task documents the convention [[T-WKSP-bun-workspace-split]] establishes; land it with or right after that split so the docs describe the live state.

1. Rewrite the `README.md` **Develop** section: replace the npm-canonical framing with `bun install` / `bun run`, update the moon command examples, and correct the **Pinned versions** table roles (Bun = install + build/typecheck; Node = test gate + artifact target). Remove the stale *"Bun … runs no task today"* line.
2. Add a brief **"Authoring moon tasks"** subsection stating the `bun run`/`bunx` rule and the deliberate node-pinned `test` gate.
3. Mirror the rule as a comment in `moon.yml` next to the task definitions, so it's visible where tasks are edited.
4. Spot-check that every command shown actually runs against the post-T-WKSP layout.

## Files to touch

| Location | Kind | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | modify | Rewrite the **Develop** section to bun-canonical commands (`bun install` / `bun run`), correct the **Pinned versions** roles (Bun = install + build/typecheck; Node = test gate + artifact target), and add the "Authoring moon tasks" note. |
| `moon.yml` | modify | Add task comments stating the `bun run`/`bunx` rule and the node-pinned `test` gate, at the edit site. |

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] AC-1: The README **Develop** section documents Bun as canonical (`bun install` / `bun run`), the moon command examples are accurate, and the **Pinned versions** roles read Bun = install + build/typecheck, Node = test gate + artifact target.
- [ ] AC-2: A stated authoring rule appears in **both** the README and a `moon.yml` comment: tasks invoke runners via `bun run`/`bunx` (not bare `tsc`/`vitest`) because runtime-only toolchains don't expose `node_modules/.bin`; the `test` task stays `toolchain: node` so `vitest` runs under Node — documented as the reason, not left implicit.
- [ ] AC-3: No stale npm-canonical claims remain — no *"npm stays canonical,"* *"wrap the same npm scripts,"* or *"Bun … runs no task today"* in `README.md` or `moon.yml`.
- [ ] AC-4: Every command shown in the rewritten docs runs successfully against the post-[[T-WKSP-bun-workspace-split]] layout.

## Out of scope

- The actual bun-canonical flip (lockfile swap, per-task toolchain, CI bootstrap) — that is [[T-WKSP-bun-workspace-split]]; this task only documents the resulting convention.

## Dependencies

- Depends on [[T-WKSP-bun-workspace-split]] (which makes Bun canonical and pins the `test` task to node); documents the convention that split establishes. Governed by [[D-0010-monorepo-tooling]] / [[M-0005-monorepo-tooling]].
